Procedural Terrain

Efficient Terrain Rendering and Chunking
difficulty:
unable to show anything after the implementation of chunking. after an entire day of debugging, find that did not change the shader from instanced to lambert.


Game Engine Tick Function and Player Physics
difficulty:
blocked by height 2 but not height 1. found that issues with "standing on the ground using y-axis collision", add 1 on y pos, so the player is actually from 1 to 2 instead of from 0 to 1
